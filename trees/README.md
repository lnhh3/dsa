# Trees

## Overview
A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship.

## Types
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- N-ary Tree
- Trie

## Key Concepts
- Root, leaf, internal nodes
- Height and depth
- Balanced vs unbalanced trees
- Tree traversals

## Traversal Methods
- **Inorder** (Left, Root, Right) - gives sorted order in BST
- **Preorder** (Root, Left, Right)
- **Postorder** (Left, Right, Root)
- **Level Order** (BFS)

## Common Problems
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- Validate Binary Search Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor
- Path Sum
- Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Time Complexity (BST)
- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst
- Insert: O(log n) average, O(n) worst
- Delete: O(log n) average, O(n) worst
