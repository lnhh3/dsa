## 🎯 Learning Path

1. **Arrays and Strings** - Start with basic array and string manipulations
2. **Linked Lists** - Understand pointer-based data structures
3. **Stacks and Queues** - LIFO and FIFO operations
4. **Trees** - Binary trees, BST, tree traversals
5. **Graphs** - BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms
6. **Sorting and Searching** - Classic algorithms
7. **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems
8. **Advanced Topics** - Tries, Heaps, Segment Trees, etc.

## 📝 Problem Template
