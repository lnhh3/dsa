# Arrays

## Overview
Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements in contiguous memory locations.

## Key Concepts
- Indexing (0-based)
- Fixed vs Dynamic arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Common operations: Insert, Delete, Search, Update

## Common Problems
- Two Sum
- Maximum Subarray
- Rotate Array
- Merge Sorted Arrays
- Find Duplicates

## Time Complexity
- Access: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert: O(n)
- Delete: O(n)

## Tips
- Use two pointers technique for many array problems
- Consider sliding window for subarray problems
- Binary search for sorted arrays
