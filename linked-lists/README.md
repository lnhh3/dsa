# Linked Lists

## Overview
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node.

## Types
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

## Key Concepts
- Node structure (data + pointer)
- Head and tail pointers
- Traversal
- Insertion and deletion

## Common Problems
- Reverse Linked List
- Detect Cycle
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Remove Nth Node from End
- Find Middle Element

## Time Complexity
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert: O(1) at head, O(n) at position
- Delete: O(1) at head, O(n) at position

## Tips
- Use slow and fast pointers for cycle detection
- Dummy node can simplify edge cases
- Practice drawing diagrams for pointer manipulation
